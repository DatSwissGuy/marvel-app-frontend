# MarvelApp (Frontend Only)

This is an educational Angular SPA consuming 2 RESTful APIs: The official Marvel API and a custom made API (Laravel). The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/DatSwissGuy/marvel-app-backend).

This project was originally generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9 and has been updated / upgraded to Angular version 10 including all dependencies (e.g. NgRx).

This Angular App was created during my internship at [Liip](https://www.liip.ch)

# Full Application
